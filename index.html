                    You're a general in the bee army of your hive. Your hive has come under attack by a group of wasps!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Your division of warrior bees stands ready to defend the queen. Below you have your four best soldiers. Each one deals a specific amount of damage. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Click on your soldiers to trigger their attack on the invading wasp. Be careful! Wasps are cunning and strong warriors and can only be defeated by dealing a precise amount of damage. This will be displayed as health specific to each attacking enemy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Use different combinations of strikes to deal the exact amount of damage needed to take out a given wasp. Too much damage will attract the attention of nearby wasps who will rally to the rescue of their fallen comrade and surely wipe out your division.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you defeat a wasp, move on to the next with a win in your corner. Otherwise, it will count as a wasp. Each enemy will have a different level of health and the effectiveness of your warriors attacks will vary between enemies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Good luck! Fight hard, defend the Queen, and protect the Hive!
